## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in the Home Assistant Supervisor API Proxy, please follow responsible disclosure:

### How to Report

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security issues via:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com)
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Security" tab in this repository
3. **Encrypted Communication**: Our PGP key is available on request

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact and attack scenarios
- Suggested fix (if available)
- Your contact information

### Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports within:

- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment
- **72 hours**: Preliminary assessment
- **7 days**: Detailed response with timeline for fixes
- **30 days**: Security patch release (for critical issues)

### Disclosure Policy

- We practice coordinated disclosure
- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- We will credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We will not pursue legal action against researchers who follow responsible disclosure

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

When deploying this add-on:

1. **Use Strong Authentication**
   - Generate a strong, unique Supervisor token
   - Rotate tokens regularly
   - Never share tokens in public repositories

2. **Network Security**
   - Configure CORS origins restrictively (avoid `"*"` in production)
   - Use HTTPS/TLS when exposing the API externally
   - Implement firewall rules to restrict access
   - Consider using VPN for external access

3. **Access Control**
   - Limit API access to trusted clients only
   - Monitor access logs for suspicious activity
   - Use network segmentation when possible

4. **Regular Updates**
   - Keep the add-on updated to the latest version
   - Monitor for security advisories
   - Update Home Assistant and Supervisor regularly

### For Developers

When integrating with this API:

1. **Secure Token Storage**
   - Store tokens securely (encrypted storage, secure environment variables)
   - Never hardcode tokens in source code
   - Use secure key management systems in production

2. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all inputs on the client side
   - Sanitize data before sending to the API
   - Handle errors gracefully without exposing sensitive information

3. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS for all API communications
   - Implement certificate pinning for mobile apps
   - Validate SSL certificates properly

4. **Error Handling**
   - Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
   - Log security-relevant events appropriately
   - Implement proper timeout handling

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Security Measures

1. **Authentication**: Token-based authentication using Supervisor tokens
2. **CORS Protection**: Configurable CORS headers to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests
3. **Input Validation**: Request validation and sanitization
4. **Error Handling**: Structured error responses without sensitive information exposure
5. **Rate Limiting**: Basic rate limiting to prevent abuse
6. **Security Headers**: Standard security headers in responses

### Potential Attack Vectors

Users should be aware of these potential security risks:

1. **Token Exposure**
   - Risk: Supervisor tokens have extensive permissions
   - Mitigation: Secure token storage, regular rotation, restrict access

2. **Network Interception**
   - Risk: API communications could be intercepted
   - Mitigation: Use HTTPS/TLS, avoid public networks

3. **Cross-Origin Attacks**
   - Risk: Malicious websites could attempt API access
   - Mitigation: Configure CORS origins restrictively

4. **Denial of Service**
   - Risk: API flooding could impact Home Assistant
   - Mitigation: Rate limiting, network controls, monitoring

### Recommended Security Configuration

```yaml
# config.yaml - Secure configuration example
log_level: info
cors_origins:
  - "https://your-trusted-app.com"  # Never use "*" in production
  - "https://your-mobile-app.com"
port: 8099
ssl: true                           # Enable SSL/TLS
certfile: fullchain.pem            # Valid SSL certificate
keyfile: privkey.pem               # Secure private key
```
